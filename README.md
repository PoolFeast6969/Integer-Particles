# Integer-Particles

Something to do with simulated particles that have their positions as integers to make collision detection easy

![Demo](https://github.com/ajasmin/PoolFeast6969/Integer-Particles/raw/master/demo.gif)

Requires python 3 because I needlessly used the new print syntax.

The actual physics seems to be pretty inaccurate, but it looks nice so it might end up being some kinda game.

10/10 would recommend making cpu bound stuff in python
